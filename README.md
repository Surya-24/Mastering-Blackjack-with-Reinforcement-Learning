# Blackjack Reinforcement Learning Environment

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that implement a Blackjack (BJ) environment for simulating and experimenting with decision-making strategies in the game.



## Files

- **BJ_Basic.ipynb**  
   - Implemented Basic Strategy 
   - Contains the implementation of the Q-learning agent and SARSA agent using Basic Strategy



- **BJ_CPCS.ipynb**  
  - Implemented  Complete Point Count System Strategy 
  - Contains the implementation of the Q-learning agent and SARSA agent using Complete Point Count System Strategy


## Environment Setup

These notebooks are designed to run in a Jupyter environment. To run them, ensure you have the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn collections
```




## Usage

To run the simulations:

  - Open either notebook in Jupyter or VSCode.
  - Run the cells sequentially.
  - Modify policy or agent logic to test custom strategies.
